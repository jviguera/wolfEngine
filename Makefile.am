# By default, make distcheck will only add wolfEngine/ as an include directory.
# So, for example, a file like unit.h that has #include
# <wolfengine/we_logging.h> won't be able to find we_logging.h, because
# wolfEngine/include isn't an include directory. We add it here.
#
# The OpenSSL lib and include directories won't be visible to make distcheck
# either because make distcheck runs ./configure with no other options. If
# OpenSSL isn't installed in a standard location, this naked configure command
# will fail to find it. We tell it where to find the include and lib directory
# for OpenSSL here.
